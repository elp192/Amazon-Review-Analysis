# Amazon Review Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, cloud Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process is performed on [Amazon Review Datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) using the following tools:<br>
- Language: PySpark<br>
- Software: Amazon Web Service (AWS), pgAdmin, PostgreSQL, Google Colab Notebook

The ETL process is applied as follow:<br>
1. Choosed a dataset from [Amazon Review Datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). In this project, [Musical Instruments](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Musical_Instruments_v1_00.tsv.gz) product is selected.
2. Created a new AWS relational database on the Amazon website.
3. Connected pgAdmin to RDS instance.
4. Created tables for database In pgAdmin (run [schema.sql](https://github.com/elp192/Amazon-Review-Analysis/blob/d1fec506dbb3d9b8c7a0cfa16f6e925da960422c/schema.sql)).
5. Created a new Google Colab Notebook ([Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb](https://github.com/elp192/Amazon-Review-Analysis/blob/df5a941da1dcdb3e450e1466e77e2c1971da4fe6/Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb)) and performed the following steps:<br>
   - Installed PySpark in Google Colab and started Spark session.<br>
   - Extracted a selected database and created a DataFrame.<br>
   - Transformed the dataset into the 4 Dataframes to match the table created in step 4 in Pgadmin.<br>
   - Connected to AWS RDS instance and loaded (written) DataFrames to their corresponding table in RDS.<br>
   - Run queries in pgAdmin to check whether the tables are populated.<br>

Note: In the Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb file, sensitive data (i.e., password and connection strings) are removed. To run the file, it is necessary to add the password and connection strings.

Amazon Vine service provides manufacturers with reviews from customers for their products and asks manufacturers to pay a fee to Amazon.
Using the [Musical_Instruments](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Musical_Instruments_v1_00.tsv.gz) dataset, we want to conclude that whether there is a bias toward reviews that were received from Vine program. In doing so, the percentage of 5-star reviews between paid (Vine) reviews and unpaid (non-Vine) reviews are compared.<br>

## Results
### Vine (paid) Reviews
- The total number of paid Vine reviews is 60.<br>
- Among all the total number of Vine reviews, 34 of them are 5-star reviews.<br>
- 56.66% of all Vine reviews are 5-stars.<br>

### Non-Vine (unpaid) Reviews
- The total number of unpaid reviews is 14477.<br>
- Among all the total number of unpaid reviews, 8212 of them are 5-star reviews.<br>
- 56.72% of all non-Vine reviews are 5-stars.<br>

## Summary
From our results, we can conclude that the percentage of 5-star from Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews are 56.66% and 56.72%, respectively. So, it seems that there is not any positive bias towards the reviews received for the Vine program.<br>
For further analysis, it is worth comparing 1-2 star reviews to analyze whether there is any bias towards reviews received for the Vine program or not. Also, in our analysis, it should be taken into account that the number of total Vine reviews is significantly less than those in non-Vine reviews. So, the sample size for our group (Vine and non-Vine reviews) is not similar. Increasing the sample size of the Vine reviews in the dataset can help us better analyze the problem.
